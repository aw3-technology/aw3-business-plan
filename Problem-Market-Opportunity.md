## Executive Summary

## The Systemic Problem

### Current Startup Ecosystem Failures

The traditional venture capital model, largely unchanged since the 1970s, exhibits fundamental inefficiencies:

**Capital Allocation Inefficiency**

- Geographic concentration: 80% of US venture capital flows to just three states

**Founder Support Gap**
- 65% of startup failures cite "team problems" as primary cause
- Solo founders face 2.5x higher failure rates than teams
- Technical founders struggle with business operations (38% cite as primary challenge)
- Average founder spends 40% of time on non-core administrative tasks

**Resource Fragmentation**
- Startups engage 7-12 different service providers in first two years
- Legal, accounting, and operational setup costs average $50,000-$150,000
- Duplicated infrastructure across portfolio companies wastes billions annually
- Knowledge silos prevent cross-pollination of best practices
