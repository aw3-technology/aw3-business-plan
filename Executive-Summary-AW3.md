# AW3 TECHNOLOGY EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
## Building the AWS of Web3

**Award-Winning Venture Studio at the Intersection of AI and Web3**

---

## The Company

**AW3 Technology** is a San Francisco-based venture studio founded in 2022 that develops and invests in early-stage startups at the intersection of AI and Web3. With a portfolio of 10 wholly-owned startups and equity stakes in 7 others, we've pioneered an AI-accelerated development methodology that delivers MVPs in 1-30 days instead of 3-6 months.

**AW3** stands for **Andromeda Web3** — named after the galaxy on a collision course with the Milky Way, symbolizing the fusion of AI and blockchain technologies where collision becomes creation.
