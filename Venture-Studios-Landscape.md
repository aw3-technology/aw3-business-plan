## What is a Venture Studio?

A venture studio (also known as a startup studio, venture builder, or company builder) is an organization that creates new companies using its own ideas and resources. Unlike accelerators or incubators that support external founders, venture studios:

- Generate ideas internally
- Provide initial capital and resources
- Recruit founding teams
- Maintain significant equity stakes (typically 30-80%)
- Offer ongoing operational support

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Higher Success Rate:** Studios report 30-50% success rates vs. 10% for traditional startups
- **Faster Time to Market:** Leveraging shared resources and expertise
- **Risk Mitigation:** Portfolio approach with shared learnings
- **Resource Efficiency:** Shared services across portfolio companies
